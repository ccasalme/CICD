# CI/CD

## CI/CD Practice

As applications scale and develop, software engineers want to ensure that certain quality checks are met prior to merging to important branches; thus, you'll want to familiarize yourself with Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) that are common practices used to ensure consistency, quality, and deployment of latest code once all checks have been met and merged to main.

GitHub Actions CI/CD Setup
Your task is to take starter code and create a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to run the component tests via Cypress when a Pull Request is made to the develop branch, and the application is deployed when code is merged from develop to the main branch.
